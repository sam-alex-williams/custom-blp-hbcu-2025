  "About": {
    "paragraph": ["At Project Stand-Up, we believe history should be celebrated, remembered, and shared in ways that bring people together. Inspired by Alfonza Scott’s book We’ve Got Something to Talk About, we created HBCU Bingo as both a game and a tribute to the incredible legacy of America’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.",
                  "For more than 250 years, HBCUs have shaped our nation—educating generations of leaders, breaking barriers, and enriching American life with perseverance, vision, and excellence. As our country prepares to honor its Semiquincentennial, we proudly shine a light on these institutions, their founders, and their lasting contributions.",
                  "Whether played at home, in schools, camps, churches, or community gatherings, HBCU Bingo is more than just fun—it’s a celebration of heritage, unity, and the shared story of progress. Together, let’s honor the past, inspire the present, and carry this legacy forward for generations to come."],
